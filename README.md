# 2_player_shooting_game_PY

Create a 2 player shooting game.
Each player has a health of 100.
Players can shoot at each other with a random power (0-5) which will reduce the opponent's health.
The Player whose health reaches 0, dies and the game ends.

There are 5 such rounds, the player with the most game wins, wins the match/tournament.

On the screen, there should be a button to start the game.
Once the game finishes, it should update the current score.
When a player wins 3 games, show the winner of the match.
